# FabricProxyPlus

**FabricProxyPlus** is a modern re-implementation of [FabricProxy](https://github.com/OKTW-Network/FabricProxy), built from scratch for Fabric servers behind a **BungeeCord** proxy. It enables IP forwarding and proper UUID handling so players can connect through a proxy and still keep their correct identity.

> ⚠️ This mod does **not** use any code from the original FabricProxy.

## 🔧 Features

- BungeeCord IP forwarding support  
- Correct player IP and UUID passthrough  
- Plug-and-play with minimal setup  
- Clean, updated codebase built for modern Fabric
