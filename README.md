# FabricProxyPlus

**FabricProxyPlus** is a modern re-implementation of [FabricProxy](https://github.com/OKTW-Network/FabricProxy), built from scratch for Fabric servers behind a **BungeeCord** proxy. It enables IP forwarding and proper UUID handling so players can connect through a proxy and still keep their correct identity.

> ⚠️ This mod does **not** use any code from the original FabricProxy.

## Notice

- This mod only supports bungee, if you want velocity, I advise you checkout [FabricProxy-Lite](https://github.com/OKTW-Network/FabricProxy-Lite).

- ## Versions currently supported:

- fabric 1.21.6
